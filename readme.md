Create a file in the `list` directory called `[uuid].json`. This must not contain the dashes as of 27/02/2022. An example would be `226d50553e4144f4a527ecbce4a6bb28.json`. You can find this at namemc.com Alternatively, if you are a moderator on the RoseSMP discord server, you may use the `/fbl (username)` command to automate the process..
