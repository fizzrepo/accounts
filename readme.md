# What is this?
fBlacklist is a simple solution to get rid of bot and spam Minecraft accounts, used on the RoseSMP to keep annoying people away. Since this is on GitHub, it is easily accessible through the use of APIs.

Create a file in the `list` directory called `[uuid].json`. This must not contain the dashes as of 27/02/2022. An example would be `226d50553e4144f4a527ecbce4a6bb28.json`. You can find this at namemc.com Alternatively, if you are a moderator on the RoseSMP discord server, you may use the `/fbl (username)` command to automate the process..
